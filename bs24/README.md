# BeSport24

# Introduction

BeSport24 was a project that lasted 4 years and a half. In that period, I design a website that helped people to learn about training providing my services as a qualified Personal Trainer and also providing valuable info through my social networks (I still use my Instagram account @BeSport24), showing the latest advances of Sports Sciences and Health.

## BeSport24 on GitHub

The purpose of this repository is to show the evolution of my website while I continue learning Web Developing.

## How the project is going

For now, the website is only available in Spanish. Maybe I'll translate it into English in the future. The first version committed are the files I developed from the version I designed using WordPress.
